# TumorModel
This is a simple beginner friendly machine learning model for tumor prediction with scikit-learn RandomForestCLassifier. 

I have given the Tumor_Model.py file along with one Training data file (gene_expression.csv) and one test data (verification_data.xlsx) to test the model's performance.

This data is retrived from Kaggle Genomic Data for Cancer - (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brsahan/genomic-data-for-cancer/data)

This is just for beginners who are interested in Machine Learning and Bioinformatics.
Let me know if there are any corrections or updations for better optimization as I'm a beginner myself
