# TumorModel

This is a simple beginner-friendly machine learning model for tumor prediction using **scikit-learn's RandomForestClassifier**.

## Project Description
I have provided the following files:
- **Tumor_Model.py**: The Python script for the machine learning model.
- **Training Data**: `gene_expression.csv` — the dataset used for training the model.
- **Test Data**: `verification_data.xlsx` — the dataset used for testing the model's performance.

### How to Use
1. Make sure you provide the correct file path for `gene_expression.csv` in your script.
2. The model uses the **RandomForestClassifier** algorithm to predict tumor presence based on gene expression data.

## Data Source
This data is retrieved from **Kaggle Genomic Data for Cancer**:
[Genomic Data for Cancer - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brsahan/genomic-data-for-cancer/data)

## Note
This project is aimed at **beginners** who are interested in **Machine Learning** and **Bioinformatics**.

### Feedback
If you have suggestions for improvements or optimizations, please let me know, as I am a beginner myself and would love to learn!
